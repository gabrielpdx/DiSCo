## **Di**screte **S**tructures **Co**mputation
Thank you for your interest in DiSCo, Discrete Structures Computation for fun, for everyone!
###You can use the first (pre-beta single-instance) module of the DiSCo project right now on the Red Hat Openshift PaaS! Check it out: [DiSCo Quiz Creator 0.1](http://disco-gpdx.rhcloud.com/)
The complete source for this web app is in the "disco\_rhcloud" directory - it is a Python3
application using Flask and SQLite.
Conversely, main.py offers an interactive CLI interface to the same database operations and
outputs a Latex file when you're done.

### Goals:
This project is intended to produce modules of use to instructors and students of
introductory Discrete Mathematics e.g. CS 250 at Portland State University MCECS.

### Status:
Currently DiSCo supports the creation and verification of an SQLite database
with a schema suitable for storing multiple choice quiz/test questions. The contents
of the database can then be output to a Latex test format for publishing and use.

### Next Steps:
See the [Issue Tracker](https://github.com/gabrielpdx/DiSCo/issues) and you
are welcome aboard!

### Licensing:
This software is released under the LGPL V3 or later.
