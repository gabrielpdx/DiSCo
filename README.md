## Discrete Structures Computation
Thank you for your interest in DiSCo, Discrete Structures Computation for fun, for everyone!
Simply run `$ python3 DiscoApp.py` locally and point your browser at localhost:5000 to manage a local SQLite database and generate LaTeX-formatted quizzes.
###Currently a proof-of-concept in active development, a single instance of this module of the DiSCo project is running on the Red Hat Openshift PaaS - check it out: [DiSCo Quiz Creator 0.1](http://disco-gpdx.rhcloud.com/)
### Goals:
This project is intended to produce modules of use to instructors and students of
introductory Discrete Mathematics e.g. CS 250/251 at Portland State University MCECS.

### Status:
Currently DiSCo supports the creation and verification of an SQLite database
with a schema suitable for storing multiple choice quiz/test questions. The contents
of the database can then be output to a LaTeX test format for publishing and use.

### Next Steps:
See the [Issue Tracker](https://github.com/gabrielpdx/DiSCo/issues) and you
are welcome aboard!

### Licensing:
This software is released under the LGPL V3 or later.
