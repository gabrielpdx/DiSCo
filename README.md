# Di(screte)S(tructures)Co(mputation)
Thank you for your interest in DiSCo, Discrete Structures Computation for fun, for everyone!

## Goals:
This project is intended to produce modules of use to instructors and students of
introductory Discrete Mathematics e.g. CS 250 at Portland State University MCECS.

## Status:
Currently DiSCo supports the creation and verification of an SQLite database
with a schema suitable for storing multiple choice quiz/test questions. A module for
generating Latex suitable for use in the classroom is next in the backlog.

## Next Steps:
See the [Issue Tracker](https://github.com/gabrielpdx/DiSCo/issues) and you
are welcome aboard!

## Licensing:
This software is released under the LGPL V3 or later.
